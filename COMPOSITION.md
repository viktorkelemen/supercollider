# Composition Guide

## Voice Roles

| Role | Function | Character |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Foundation** | Harmonic anchor | Slow-moving, low, constant |
| **Pulse** | Time feel | Repetitive, steady, hypnotic |
| **Movement** | Rhythmic interest | Syncopation, fills, variation |
| **Color** | Texture/atmosphere | Pads, noise, ambience |
| **Focus** | Melody/hook | What the ear follows |

You don't need all five. Ambient might only use Foundation + Color. Techno might be Pulse + Movement + Color.

## The Energy Arc

Every piece needs shape. For 5 minutes:

```
Energy
  ▲
  │         ╱╲
  │        ╱  ╲      ╱╲
  │    ╱──╱    ╲────╱  ╲
  │───╱                  ╲───
  └──────────────────────────▶ Time
    intro  build  peak  breath  resolve
```

**Key principle**: Tension → Release → Tension → Release

## Layering Philosophy

**Add by subtraction**: Start with everything, mute until it breathes.

**Enter slowly, exit quickly**: New elements fade in over 8 bars. They can vanish instantly.

**One new idea at a time**: Let each element establish itself before the next enters.

**Leave holes**: The silence between notes matters as much as the notes.

## Hybrid Composition (Sequenced + Modular)

Think of it as two performers:

| Sequenced | Improvised (Modular) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Predictable | Reactive |
| Structural backbone | Textural response |
| Composed phrases | Happy accidents |
| Clock/timing | Drift/humanity |

**The conversation**: One proposes, the other responds.

## Arrangement Structure (5 Minutes)

### Intro (0:00–1:00)
- One or two elements only
- Establish mood, not rhythm
- Give listener time to arrive

### Development (1:00–2:30)
- Add pulse
- Introduce harmonic movement
- Each element earns its place

### Peak (2:30–3:30)
- Maximum density (but not chaos)
- All voices speaking
- This is what they came for

### Breakdown (3:30–4:15)
- Strip to foundation
- Create absence
- Makes the return matter

### Resolution (4:15–5:00)
- Partial return or fade
- Resolve tension
- Leave them wanting more

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **What's the one thing?** If someone remembers one element, what is it?
2. **Where's the peak?** Every piece needs a moment of arrival.
3. **What creates tension?** Dissonance, density, rising pitch, faster rhythm?
4. **What releases it?** Resolution, space, dropping elements, lower register?
5. **Why does element X exist?** If you can't answer, remove it.

## Constraints That Work

- **Three voice maximum** at any moment
- **One element changes** per section
- **Repetition is your friend** – vary only 10-20%
- **Silence is an instrument**
- **The low end is the foundation** – get that right first

## Tension and Release Techniques

### Building Tension
- Add voices/layers
- Rise in pitch or register
- Increase rhythmic density
- Introduce dissonance
- Filter opening (brighter)
- Volume swells

### Releasing Tension
- Remove elements
- Drop to lower register
- Simplify rhythm
- Resolve to consonance
- Filter closing (darker)
- Create space/silence

---

## Genre Approaches

### Ambient
- Foundation + Color only
- Very slow energy arc
- Texture over rhythm
- Let things breathe

### Techno/Electronic
- Pulse is central
- Movement creates groove
- Filter sweeps for arc
- Drops create drama

### Dub
- Space is the instrument
- Delay/reverb as voices
- Subtractive arrangement
- Let echoes speak

### Minimal
- One idea, explored deeply
- Micro-variations
- Patience rewarded
- Less is more
