## Techniques to Explore

Based on these artists, key SuperCollider areas to develop:

- **Generative sequencing** (Autechre, Caterina Barbieri)
- **Dub delay/feedback systems** (Vladislav Delay, Pole)
- **Granular processing** (Fennesz, Tim Hecker)
- **Slow envelope evolution** (Éliane Radigue, Stars of the Lid)
- **Harmonic series exploration** (Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, Suzanne Ciani)
- **Tape degradation simulation** (William Basinski, Deepchord)
- **Micro-sound / sine wave purity** (Alva Noto)
- **Organic modulation sources** (Buchla-style randomness)
