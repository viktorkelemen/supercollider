## 1. Rhythm & Beat Pattern (0-10)

### Accuracy
- [ ] Avoids predictable four-on-the-floor pattern
- [ ] Syncopation creates hypnotic effect
- [ ] Off-beats emphasized appropriately
- [ ] Kick placement feels "broken" not random

### Questions
1. Does the kick pattern avoid landing on every downbeat?
2. Do the off-beats feel like they could be on-beats (perception shift)?
3. Is there a consistent groove despite the broken pattern?
4. For 3-step: does the triplet feel create a rolling sensation?
5. Are snare/clap placements unpredictable but musical?
6. Could you dance to this in a township party?

### Pattern Analysis
```
Your kick pattern (16 steps):
[ ][ ][ ][ ] | [ ][ ][ ][ ] | [ ][ ][ ][ ] | [ ][ ][ ][ ]

Reference gqom pattern:
[X][ ][ ][X] | [ ][X][ ][ ] | [X][ ][ ][X] | [ ][ ][X][ ]
```

**Score: __ /10**

## 2. Atmosphere & Mood (0-10)

### Accuracy
- [ ] Creates dark, tense feeling

2. Is there tension without resolution (the "never-drop" feeling)?
3. Does the atmosphere sustain over the track length?
4. Are there spooky/unsettling elements (strings, vocals, space)?
5. Does it create a sense of perpetual build-up?
6. Is the mood consistent throughout?

### The Tension Test
Gqom should feel like a "build-up that never drops":
- [ ] Energy builds but doesn't release conventionally

## 3. Kick & Bass Character (0-10)

### Accuracy

- [ ] Not clean/sterile sounding

### Questions
1. Does the kick thump in your chest?
2. Is there distortion/saturation giving it character?
3. Does it sound like it came from a basic setup, not a pro studio?
4. Is the low end heavy but not muddy?
5. Does the kick have a "noisy" quality?
6. Would this sound good on a taxi speaker system?

### Measurement
```
sc_get_analysis → pitch, timbre
- Kick fundamental frequency: ___ Hz (expected: 40-80 Hz)
- Spectral centroid: ___ Hz (expected: 80-200 Hz)
- Distortion present: yes/no
```

**Score: __ /10**

## 4. Dark Strings/Pads (0-10)

### Accuracy
- [ ] Creates haunting atmosphere

### Questions
1. Do the pads set a cinematic, eerie mood?
2. Is there harmonic movement or is it drone-based (should be drone)?
3. Is the pad filtered dark (low-pass)?
4. Does it provide bed for the rhythm without dominating?
5. Does the timbre suggest strings or synth pads?
6. Is there subtle movement (detune, filter modulation)?

### Reference Centroid
```
sc_get_analysis → timbre
- Pad centroid: ___ Hz (expected: 200-800 Hz for dark character)
- Spectral flatness: ___ (should be < 0.2 for tonal)
```

**Score: __ /10**

## 5. Percussion & Layers (0-10)

### Accuracy
- [ ] Tom rolls present where appropriate
- [ ] Claps/snares syncopated

2. Are percussion layers sparse enough to breathe?
3. Is there dynamic variation in percussion velocity?
4. Do percussion elements enter/exit to create interest?
5. Is the snare/clap thuddy (not crisp/snappy)?
6. Are hi-hats sparse or absent (gqom typically minimal hi-hats)?

### Tom Roll Assessment
- [ ] Velocity increases toward phrase end
- [ ] Creates anticipation without resolution
- [ ] Tuning is deep/dark

**Score: __ /10**

---

## 6. Vocal Treatment (0-10)

### Accuracy
- [ ] Vocals chopped/sliced if present

6. Are there Zulu/African vocal character elements?

### If No Vocals
If experiment doesn't use vocals:
- [ ] Atmospheric elements fill the role adequately

**Score: __ /10** (or N/A if vocals not targeted)

---

## 7. Space & Sparseness (0-10)

### Accuracy
- [ ] Not over-produced or cluttered
- [ ] Silence used effectively
- [ ] Room for sounds to breathe
- [ ] "Less is more" principle followed

### Questions
1. Could you add more elements, or would that ruin it?
2. Does silence/space contribute to the mood?
3. Is there reverb creating sense of space?
4. Are elements spread across the stereo field appropriately?
5. Does the arrangement feel minimal but complete?
6. Is there rawness/roughness (not over-polished)?

### Density Test
Count simultaneous elements at the busiest moment:
- 1-2: Very sparse (maybe too empty)
- 3-4: Ideal gqom density
- 5-6: Getting busy
- 7+: Probably too cluttered for gqom

**Element count at peak: ___**

**Score: __ /10**
