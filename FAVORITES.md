## Hiroshi Yoshimura

**File:** `organic/hiroshi_yoshimura.scd`

**Style:** Environmental music, gentle synthesis, pentatonic harmony

**Favorite experiments:**
- NINE POST CARDS — Classic style, gentle melodies with occasional water drops
- GREEN — Lower register, longer sustains
- PIER AND LOFT — Two-voice interplay
- FLORA — Bright register, more active
- SOUNDSCAPE — Maximum space, very sparse

**What works:**
- Just intonation pentatonic scale `[1, 9/8, 5/4, 3/2, 5/3]`
- Pure sine-based tones with subtle harmonics
- Linen envelopes with sine curves
- Sparse, unpredictable timing
- Intimate stereo field

## Venetian Snares

**File:** `idm/venetian_snares.scd`

**Style:** Breakcore, odd meters, classical + amen fusion

**Favorite experiments:**
- ROSSZ CSILLAG — Bartók-influenced strings over chopped breakbeats at 170 BPM

**What works:**
- Odd time signatures (7/8, 5/4, 7/4) for asymmetric feel
- Pitched/tuned drums with `\freq` parameter
- Hungarian minor scale influence `[C D Eb F# G Ab B]`
- Retrigger rolls with ascending pitch sweeps
- Layering classical strings with aggressive breaks
